    <p>
        QuasiSpecies peer review is a website designed to help researchers to improve their skills when deciding which Journal is the best for a paper.
        Authors usually produce works which can have different qualities. These papers are submitted to journals that have different impact. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Authors and Journals want to increase their impact. From the point of view of an author, sending works to higher impact journals can let their works to achieve
        better impact. In the other side, journals want to publish high quality articles in order to increase the visibility of their issues and get a better impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this perspective, authors and editors need impact to survive. Those journals with very low impact face a high risk of being removed from indexes and 
        loosing the interest of researchers. Authors with low impact assume an high cost in terms of lack of visibility.

        In the submission process, authors send their works to a selected Journal and then, a review process starts. Usually, a paper will be reviewed by other authors
        which are considered experts in the field of the work, this process is called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review' title='Peer review'>peer review</a>.

        Reviewers need to ensure that the quality of the article is according with the quality requirements of the journal. If an article meets the desired quality, then 
        the reviewers propose the Editor to publish the article. If an article doesn't meet the expected quality, reviewers can propose amending o reject the article. 
        
        Finally, the Editor take a decission by accepting, rejecting or asking the authors to solve issues found in their manuscript.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing and article cost effort and time, while the reviewing process also takes time. So authors pay time and effort when writing an sending their papers to journals.
        If an article is rejected, author must decide what to do. Sometimes author would decide to send their article to another journal, which starts another review process.
        Authors could also decide to improve their article before sending it again. Finally, authors can decide not to sending their paper again.

        Sometimes an author can write a good quality article and decide to send it to medium or even low impact journal. If the article gets published, the potential 
        visibility of the article is lower thant the potential reward that the author could have achieved.

        In any case, these decisions imply costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this scenario, the need for reduce the cost of publishing an article is clear. Authors gain expertisement when publishing article into journal and receiving
        the publishing decision. So, as time goes by, author would improve their abilities when choosing suitable journals. Novice researchers can have more difficulty
        to reduce their publishing cost.

        The major difficulty lies in the ability of an author to identify the quality of their own work. It's possible that an author cant' distinguish between
        low and medium quality works, or between medium an high works or it's even possible for an author not to distinguish the overall quality of any type of paper.
        We can call the author ability to identify the quality of a manuscript as the <span class="text--bold">author's partition</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the author's partition, every author have a <span class="text--bold">submission profile</span>. A submission profile define the type of journal chosen
        by an author based on the author's partition. That is, if an author can't distinguish between low and medium quality articles, maybe the author can decide to send this
        type of article to medium impact journals. 

        Partition and submission profile have a direct effect over the reward achieved by an author. So it's important to train authors to modify them in order to improve
        their potential rewards when publishig.
